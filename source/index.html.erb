            <h3>What is Ruby?</h3>
            <p>Ruby is "a dynamic, open sourced programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity." Designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto in Japan, Ruby was influenced by Perl, Smaltalk, Eiffel, Ada, and Lisp. With a chief focus in flexibility, Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including funcitonal, object oriented, and imperative. Futhermore, Ruby is dynamically typed and employs an automatic memeory management system. </p>

            <h3>Installation</h3>
            <p>Before we start with the Ruby installation I'm going to assume that you are running Unbuntu or some other Linux distribution, either natively or in a virtual machine. If not, please make sure that you are before proceeding with the Ruby installation. Secondly, make sure that your distribution is up to date before proceeding.</p>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
            This tutorial is designed for those you are comfortable with using a browser. Most fundamentally, when you look at a webpage in a Web browser, you see words. But most of the time webpages also contain images, video clips, and background music, besides the styled text. They may include drop-down menus, search boxes, external links, or some customized features.
A typical webpage depends on several technologies to control what the end-user sees, but most fundamentally, developers write webpages in HTML, without which there can be no webpages. To display the page on the client-side device, a browser starts out by reading the HTML.

		<h2>A brief History</h2>
		<p>
            Tim Berners-Lee, physicist at CERN (the European Organization for Nuclear Research), devised a way in the late 1980s for scientists to share documents over the Internet. Before that, Internet communication had been limited to plain text, using technologies such as email, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and Usenet-based discussion boards. HTML used a content model stored on a central server but transferrable to a local workstation and viewable in a browser, simplifying access to content and making "rich" content possible (such as sophisticated text formatting and images).

		<h2>What is HTML?</h2>
		<p>
            HTML is a markup language. The word markup was used by editors who marked up manuscripts (usually with a blue pencil) when giving instructions for revisions. "Markup" now means something slightly different: a language with specific syntax that instructs a Web browser how to display a page. Once again, HTML separates "content" (words, images, audio, video, and so on) from "presentation" (instructions for displaying each type of content). HTML uses a pre-defined set of elements to define content types. Elements contain one or more "tags" that contain or express content. Tags are enclosed by angle brackets, and the closing tag begins with a forward slash.
The paragraph element consists of the start tag "&lt;p&gt;" and the closing tag "&lt;/p&gt;" The following example shows a paragraph contained within the HTML paragraph element. Remember that your browser will not display more than one space character in a row.

		<h2>Elements</h2>
		<p>
            HTML documents are made up by HTML elements.
HTML elements are written with a start tag, with an end tag, with the content in between:
<pre><code>
&lt;tagname&gt;content&lt;/tagname&gt;
</code></pre>
 
Here is a simple example:

HTML elements can be nested (elements can contain elements).
This example contains 3 HTML elements:


</p>
        </div>

              <div class="section">
		<h2>Attributes</h2>
		<p>
           The start tag may contain additional information, as in the preceding example. Such information is called an attribute. Attributes usually consist of 2 parts:
An attribute name
An attribute value
Attribute values that consist of a single word or number may be written as they are, but you must enclose values containing spaces in quotation marks (either single (') or double (") quotes). Many developers always use quotes to avoid mistakes like this:


</p>
        </div>

		<h2>Comments and doctype</h2>
		<p>
           HTML has a mechanism for embedding comments that are not displayed when the page is rendered in a browser. This is useful for explaining a section of markup, leaving notes for other people who might work on the page, or for leaving reminders for yourself. HTML comments are enclosed in symbols as follows:

Besides tags, text content, and entities, an HTML document must contain a doctype declaration as the first line. The doctype declaration is not an HTML tag, but rather tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in.
In HTML5, there is only one declaration and is written like this:

</p>
        </div>
